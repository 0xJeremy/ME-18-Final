Date: 04/28/20

Setup: Moving the test fixture by sliding it to designated position determined by a tape measure. The motion is limited to 1D by placing the fixture on a 4-wheel. unpowered LEGO car.
UPDATED: These trials has all 6 axis of data. Because of that the sampling rate could be compromised.

Movements: 0_20_40_60

File Naming:
date-dim-mode-#ofsensors-speed-trialnumber

Note: "distances(cm)" consists of the positions at which the car travels to in order with respect to the starting position, which is 0cm. For example, 0414_0_20_40_0_slow_1 means the car starts at 0, moves to 20cm, 40cm, and then back to 0cm.

For the current naming scheme, there will only be 4 distinct positions.
